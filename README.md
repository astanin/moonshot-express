Moonshot Express
================

_This mini game is a submission for [Game Off
2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) game jam._

Moonshot Express is the first private space delivery company. Its
reusable rockets fly to to the Moon every 60 seconds. But even reusable
rockets cost a lot to launch. You're a billionaire CEO, and your job is
to keep the enterprise profitable. But it's an easy job, really. Load as
much stuff as possible on each space craft, and you will keep Moon
colonists happy, and earn more billions.
